# OpenHantek [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OpenHantek/openhantek.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/OpenHantek/openhantek)
OpenHantek is a free software for Hantek (Voltcraft/Darkwire/Protek/Acetech) USB digital storage oscilloscopes based on HantekDSO and has started as an alternative to the official Hantek DSO software.

Supported operating systems:
* Linux
* MacOSX
* Windows (You need to download the [WinUSB driver files](http://libusb-winusb-wip.googlecode.com/files/winusb%20driver.zip) and customize the inf file for your device yourself at the moment)

## Building OpenHantek from source
You need the following packages, to build OpenHantek from source:
* CMake 3.0+
* Qt 5.3+
* FFTW 3+ (prebuild files will be downloaded on windows)
* libusb 1.x (prebuild files will be downloaded on windows)
* binutils-dev

For debian based systems (Ubuntu, Mint) install named requirements like this:
> apt-get install cmake git libfftw3-dev libqt5opengl5-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev

For rpm based distributions (Fedora) use this command:
> dnf install cmake qt5-qtbase-gui qt5-qttools-devel qt5-qttranslations fftw-devel libusbx-devel binutils-devel libusb-1.0-0-devel

For MacOSX use homebrew
> brew update
> brew install libusb fftw qt5;

After you've installed the requirements either run **cmake-gui** or run the following commands inside the directory of this package:
> mkdir build <br>
> cd build <br>
> cmake ../
> make -j4 (for 4 concurrent compile jobs)
> make install (optional, for installing only)

You can specify an install prefix when running cmake:
> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

## Firmware
Your DSO does not store its firmware permanently -- the firmware has to be sent to the device each time it is connected. The `firmware` directory of this project contains the binary firmware extracted from Hantek's Windows drivers, and a udev rule to upload the firmware to the device automatically each time it is plugged in.

* Install the `firmware/*.hex` files into `/usr/local/share/hantek/`.
* Install the `firmware/90-hantek.rules` file into `/etc/udev/rules.d/`.
* install fxload (fxload is a program which downloads firmware to USB  devices  based  on
       AnchorChips  EZ-USB, Cypress EZ-USB FX, or Cypress EZ-USB FX2 microcontrollers.)
* Add your current user to the **plugdev** group.

## Building Debian/Ubuntu package

Run `debuild -i -us -uc -b` to build a deb binary package.

See `Build-Depends` in the file `debian/control` for the list of dependencies
you'll need to install.
